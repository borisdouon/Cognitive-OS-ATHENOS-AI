# === ATHENOS AI — GLOBAL CURSOR RULES ===
# Enforce sovereignty, privacy, and phased discipline

# ——— 1. CORE DISCIPLINE ———
- Always use TDD: Write **unit + integration tests BEFORE** any implementation
- Never implement a feature without a passing test
- Run `cargo test` after every change and show results
- All functions must log: `tracing::info!("{}: {:?}", fn_name, args)` + error handling

# ——— 2. PRIVACY & DATA SOVEREIGNTY ———
- **Never** send any user data to cloud without explicit, granular consent
- Default: 100% on-device processing (SQLite, local embeddings, local LLM inference)
- Cloud sync only via `opt_in_cloud_sync: bool` in `ConsentLedger`
- Encrypt all local data with `sodiumoxide` or `ring`
- Provide one-click data deletion UI

# ——— 3. PHASED EXECUTION (NO PHASE SKIPPING) ———
- **Phase A only** until user says: “Proceed to Phase B”
- **Phase B only** after Phase A is 100% tested and committed
- **Phase C+** blocked until prior phases are verified
- Current phase must be stated in every agent response: `// CURRENT PHASE: A`

# ——— 4. SCOPE CONTROL ———
- **No UI** beyond:
  - Consent screen
  - Daily Cognitive Report Dashboard (Recharts: focus, time saved, pattern graph)
  - Action approval console (1-click approve/undo)
- No dark mode, animations, themes, or mobile views
- No frontend framework except React + Tailwind (Tauri)

# ——— 5. DOCUMENTATION & TRACEABILITY ———
- Always cite exact line numbers from:
  - `Athenos_AI_Strategy.md`
  - `Strategic_Reinforcements_Gap_Closures.md`
  - `TRAINING CONCEPT.txt`
- Use `@Athenos_AI_Strategy.md#Phase-A-Step-3` syntax in comments
- Every generated file must include:
  ```rust
  /// Phase: A | Step: 4 | Source: Athenos_AI_Strategy.md#L72
——— 6. TECH STACK LOCK ———

Backend: Rust + Tauri
DB: rusqlite (local), vecs (vector embeddings)
AI: candle (local inference), DistilBERT fine-tuned on athenos_data.jsonl
No Python, no Node.js backend
No external APIs except opt-in federated learning

——— 7. TESTING & SANDBOX ———

Every automation must run in sandbox before suggestion
Use std::process::Command in isolated dir or Docker stub
Provide undo() function with full diff log
Simulate 3 user profiles in tests: Developer, Accountant, Designer

——— 8. AGENT BEHAVIOR ———

Never suggest features outside current phase
Never add dependencies without approval
If unsure, ask: “Should I implement X? (Phase Y)”
End every response with:textPhase [X] complete. Tests: PASS. Ready for next?

——— 9. DELIGHT & METRICS ———

Show quantified wins in report: +11 min saved, Focus +22%
Use CognitiveClarityIndex, EmotionalResilienceScore from docs
Log to metrics/ for alpha cohort

——— 10. FINAL GUARDRAIL ———

If any rule is violated, stop and alert:VIOLATION: [Rule #X]. Reverting changes.
